# UN-Vision-AI Demo Application

This  application demonstrates an implementation of [UN-Vision-AI]([https://github.com/roy-saurabh/un-vision-ai]) using Streamlit front end library.

UN-Vision-AI leverages open-source python libraries for generating data visualizations and data-faithful infographics. It is grammar agnostic (will work with any programming language and visualization libraries e.g. matplotlib, seaborn, altair, d3 etc) and works with multiple large language model providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, PaLM, Cohere, Huggingface). 

See the project page [here](https://github.com/roy-saurabh/un-vision-ai) for updates.
